# CSE201-Assignments

This repository contains all my assignments in the CSE201 - Advanced Programming course at IIIT Delhi.

To run the programs, clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Zynade/CSE201-assignments.git```

Next, open each directory individually as a project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA. Then, build and run the project.

# Note

There were only two assignment submissions in Monsoon 2022. There was also a project component, for which I coded up a [Tank Stars clone](https://githhttps://github.com/Zynade/Tank-Starsub.com/Zynade/Tank-Stars). Check it out [here!](https://github.com/Zynade/Tank-Stars)
